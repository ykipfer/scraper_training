# LinkedIn Scraper

Create a scraper that will go to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=&location=&geoId=&trk=guest_homepage-basic_jobs-search-bar_search-submit&position=1&pageNum=0) and scrape the following information for ads from Switzerlabd:
- ad ID
- ad title
- ad location
- date published
- url to ad content
- ad company

Only scrape ads that are no older than 7 days and save the results under `output/ads.csv`.
